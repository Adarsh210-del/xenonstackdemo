This project comprises of two folders
Client and Server
For running the client folder you have to first run the "npm install" commnand in the command prompt
For running the server folder you have to again run the "npm install" commnad in the command prompt

The client folder consists of home,contact us,login,sign up and logout routes
For the client side I have used React JS library which make the user experience smooth. For the backend I have the Express JS server and also implemented the authentication for the same.  The database used for this projecy is MongoDB. The database design is also created by me at my own.
